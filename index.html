            <p>This work is related to password-strength meters/checkers, which is that red and green bar informing you about the quality of your password when you are creating one on a registration webpage.<br>
            We analyzed meters on highly popular websites to reveal their inner working. Results show critical weaknesses that may defeat the purpose of these meters: encouraging users to <b>willingly</b> choose better passwords.</p>

            <p>On this website, you will find our NDSS 2014 paper along with a slightly extended version that gives more details on analyzed meters; a multi-checker tool we built to gather all password checkers into one place; and the sources and resources involved in this project.</p>

            <p>You can download the <a href="./data/passwords-ndss-2014-slides.pdf">slides of our NDSS talk here</a>.</p>
